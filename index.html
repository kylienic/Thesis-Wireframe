                    We live in a digital image culture. Screens surround our world and mediate our everyday experiences. The dominance of images in cultural communication has been studied extensively<!-- [1,2,3,4] -->. As our world becomes increasingly digital, so do our images. Today more than ever before images are natively digital. Moreover, the production locus of cultural images has shifted to the individual. Using phones, people can take, edit and share images that weave a public narrative of their lives and craft their identity. Anyone with a smart phone has a powerful camera and image processor in the palm of their hand. 
                    </p>

                    <p class="lead paragraph">
                    We, as a society, are becoming literate in digital image editing, something that was previously left to the professionals or anyone who took the time to learn a computer-based tool such as GIMP or Photoshop. Today, mobile applications have built on the 20-year tradition of image editing and capitalized on the readiness of the public to take editing into their own hands. Mobile applications such as Adobe Photoshop Express, Instagram and VSCO Cam make simple image edits as easy as the slide of a finger. On the computer, consumer-level editing tools such as iPhoto allow users to retouch images at the click of a magic wand. The aforementioned applications standardize editing to limited controls, offering slight ranges of adjustments rather than full control.
                    </p>

                    <p class="lead paragraph">
                    What is now necessary is an unpacking of the processes that <i>inform</i> these editing platforms. What are people doing to the pixel data when they apply an instagram filter or up the exposure in VSCO Cam? Is editing solely something that is an "after" process, seperate from image capture? My argument is no. In the digital age, image editing is an integral step to the image <i>creation</i> process. I use the word creation because no longer is capture the only step involved with image creation. </p>

                    <p class="lead paragraph">
                    Digital Image editing and adjustments are all algorithms run by the computer. This knowledge is housed in upper-level computer science coursework and research. Image editing tools take great pains to develop user interfaces that focus on the <i>result</i> of the image editing rather than the process. Here, I focus on the process. I unpack the mathematical algorithms behind some of the most popular image adjustments in an effort to understand the connection between digital imaging, human perception and computer science.</p> 

                    <p class="lead paragraph">
                    As a photographer (and a former math major), I was always interested in the interaction between math and images. I was frustrated by the distinct disciplinary separation between the fields, as well as the social connotations of each: "math, that's so hard!" or by scientists: "art, that's not academic!" I found it difficult to apply one to the other within a classroom context, as each was focused on its own discipline. Here, I make the argument that both digital images and their algorithms are academic-- and that the intersection of them is an important area of study. They are each integral processes for the capture and ultimately exploration of our identities and our place in the world. </p>

In a color image, each pixel is assigned a color. In the RGB color space, each pixel color has three values: red, green, and blue, which represent light intensity recorded at each area of the image. Each pixel is a numerical representation of light data that was recorded by the image sensor. This data can be manipulated and expressed in a variety of ways.</p>

            <p>The image is focused directly onto the camera sensor, which records the incoming light. The sensor consists of thousands, if not millions, of light-sensitive <b>photosites</b> which accumulate a charge from the incoming light. Each photosite accumulates a charge, which it then outputs in the form of a voltage waveform. This initial charge is a physical (or analog) measurement. Before it can be processed, it must be converted to a digital signal, which will be discussed in the next section.</p>

            <p>Photosites are <i>atomic picture sensing elements</i> which capture continuous light in discrete samples. The magnitude of the charge depends on the strength and duration of light exposure. For example, brighter portions of an image result from higher-charged photosites than their dimmer companions. Photosites are arranged in rows and columns on a flat rectangular sensor- they exist in  a two-dimensional array.</p>

            <p>A typical sensor consists of 4000x4000 photosites or more. Each photosite corresponds to a pixel in the resulting image, so image size and resolution depends greatly on the size and quality of the image sensor. Image pixels are also arranged in two-dimensional arrays.</p>
            
            <p>Math fact: A camera sensor produces a digital output proportional to the integral of the light received at each sensor.</p>

            <p>Once recorded, the individual analog charge magnitudes are digitized: converted to discrete numerical quantities. The analog signal is continuous, while the digital signal (by definition) is discrete. In order to convert the analog signal to digital, the analog signal is sampled (measured at regular intervals) and then quantized (assigned to a set of integer values). This process occurs within an analog-to-digital circuit.</p>

            <p>During quantization, each sampled value is assigned an integer representation. Pixel intensity ranges from 0 to 255, and so each value must be mapped to the integer value that most closely represents it. The result is stored in an array. A digital image is, therefore, a sampled collection of integer values that <i>represent</i> light recorded by the image sensor.

            <p>The image array can have any number of operations performed on it, which is known as <b>digital image processing.</b> A common operation performed during quantization is noise reduction, which consists of averaging image data. This is performed by an Arithmetic Logic Unit, which performs arithmetic and logical operations on entire images in parallel.</p>

            <p>If a camera is not storing RAW (or uncompressed) image data, it must convert the data to a smaller image file format. Image file formats include JPEG, PNG, GIF, among others. These conversions require compression of image data, which can result in diminished image quality. However, compression is necessary for fast transmission of images across web-enabled devices, as well as for mass storage of images. Conversion is performed in the image processing stage, before the image is stored onto long-term media storage. Often a camera will apply a tone curve, or light contrast adjustment to an image before it is converted and saved in JPEG or PNG format.</p>

                        As society continues progressing, inventing new technologies and acquiring more and more knowledge, it is more important than ever to encourage interdisciplinary cooperation and exploration. One person simply cannot know everything. The current American educational system encourages specialization through choosing a “major” and a singular career path. This sort of diciplinary specialization is absolutely necessary: many of our greatest achievements would not have been possible without great scientists devoting their lives to one area. However, what is becoming increasingly important is training people who can speak between disciplines: someone who understands both aesthetics and code, music and business administration. This project seeks to educate those who may be more artistically minded about the powerful processes <i>behind</i> aesthetics. By demonstrating how light and computation contribute to image formation, this project draws a tangible link between the fields of art and technology—one that should be drawn more often. Rather than sectioning people off into “artist” or “engineer” categories, we should take a lesson from the Bauhaus movement and encourage “Art + Technology”.  Technology is a powerful tool to realize ideas (especially interdisciplinary or creative ideas) in today’s digital age. Without technology and STEM education, we lack the literacy necessary to fully realize our creative ideas. </p>

                        <p class="lead">This project is a visual-based and interactive explanation of a scientific topic. It uses an interesting and wide-reaching topic (digital photography) to get viewers excited about STEM. Rather than teaching math and then briefly covering digital photography as one application, this project focuses first on the application, using it as an entry point to then explore a variety of mathematical topics. By turning the typical educational process on its head, this project offers a new approach to STEM education by incorporating art and technology. </p>
