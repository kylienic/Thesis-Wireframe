notes on youtube video: Lightroom Exposure vs Brightness
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cWsiqunvJU

exposure, recovery, fill light, blacks --> placed above the line b/c they are designed to work in specific tonal regions of the image.
-- blacks (darkest)- bottom 10%
-- fill light (med dark)- next bottom 20%
-- exposure (med light)-- 70%
-- recovery (brightest) -- top 10%
--
brightness, contrast --> overall adjustments

EXPOSURE, Y'ALL:

Exposure slider tries to mimick overall exposure adjustment of the image. similar to white points in photoshop. which tonal value is your whitest and how white that should be. moves up the light values and eventually clips. merges lights into highlights once they get there. 

Photoshop and Lightroom + other editors have different formulas for exposure adjustments and how they handle brightness values in particular. 

newExposure = oldExposure * (2^ exposureCompensation);
but it's not that simple. Photoshop transfers the value using a reverse gamma curve, then changes values, then re-applies a gamma curve back so that the brightest pixels are less prone to be burned (pushed over max value of 255) source: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12166117/what-is-the-math-behind-exposure-adjustment-on-photoshop

BRIGHTNESS:
- brightness tries not to clip; maintains detail by maintaining separation in tonal values.
