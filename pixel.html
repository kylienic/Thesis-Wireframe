Pixel is short for picture element. A pixel is an atomic picture element that forms the basis of pixel-based images. (other image formats such as ____ are not pixel based.) A standard pixel is a square, [size]. Pixels are represented by numeric values based on the image data. A pixel has two representations: visual (a colored square) and numeric (an intensity value or an RGB value). Pixels are formed via the quantization process of digital image data. Data from the image sensor is constrained and transformed into pixel data. [look at Tanimoto book]
